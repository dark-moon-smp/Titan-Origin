Impact: 🔴🔴🔴

🟢 Mega Mine: When you mine a block, the blocks nearby it will be mined as well. Thanks, giant hands!

🟢 Huge Heart: Your heart (and all of your other organs of course) are way larger than a normal human, leaving you with twice the health and increased movement and reach.

🟢 Biological Barricades: Unlike creatures made of cells, you sink in water and don't take drowning or fire damage.

🟡 Immense Individual: You are 32 blocks tall.

🔴 Titanic Trouble: You have trouble fitting into "small" (to you) spaces and precisely aiming.
